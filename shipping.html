            <h4>US SHIPPING</h4>

            <p>All items ordered and paid for will ship within 1 business day unless otherwise noted in the product
                description. Orders may take up to 10 business days to arrive for standard shipping.</p>

            <p>International orders may take 7-14 business days to arrive; payment of duties and taxes may be required.
                We are unable to ship to forwarding addresses. If an order is placed with a forwarding shipping address,
                the order may be canceled automatically by our system. </p>

            <p>Free standard shipping is valid on US orders over $50, before tax and after discount. To offer a better
                shipping experience to our customers, most orders are shipped from our fulfillment center in Illinois.
