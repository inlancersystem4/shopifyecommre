            <h4>SECTION 1 - WHAT DO WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION?</h4>

            <p>When you purchase something from our store, as part of the buying and selling process, we collect the
                personal information you give us such as your name, address and email address. When you browse our
                store, we also automatically receive your computerâ€™s internet protocol (IP) address in order to provide
                us with information that helps us learn about your browser and operating system.</p>

            <p>Email marketing: With your permission, we may send you emails about our store, new products and other
                updates. </p>

            <h4>SECTION 2 - CONSENT</h4>

            <p>How do you get my consent?</p>

            <p>When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place
                an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting it
                and using it for that specific reason only. If we ask for your personal information for a secondary
                reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with
                an opportunity to say no.</p>

            <p>How do I withdraw my consent?</p>

            <p>If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the
                continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at any time, by contacting us.</p>

            <h4>SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE</h4>

            <p>We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms
                of Service.</p>
