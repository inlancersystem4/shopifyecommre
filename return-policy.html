            <h4>30-DAY RETURNS</h4>

            <p>Your satisfaction is our top priority and we will do what we can to ensure your happiness with every
                purchase. We review each return with detail and care.</p>

            <p>We offer complimentary returns within 30 days of purchase. To return, please pack the items safely back
                into the original packaging (if possible) and follow the steps in the Herbivore return portal. Once we
                receive the package and inspect the product(s), the total amount minus the original shipping cost will
                be returned back to your original form of payment. </p>

            <p>The returned item must have at least 50% or more of the product left in the bottle/jar in order to
                qualify. If the product does not meet the return requirements, store credit will be issued instead. We
                are unable to accept returns of partial sets or bundles.
            </p>

            <p>Once the return is approved, please allow 10 days for the return to be processed. </p>

            <p>Please note: We are not able to refund original shipping charges as these are paid directly to the
                carrier. Herbivore does not refund orders for packages that are lost or stolen. Purchases made through
                unauthorized Herbivore retailers do not qualify for a refund or exchange.</p>
